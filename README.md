# My MagicMirror Build

This repository is the complete documentation of my [MagicMirror](https://magicmirror.builders/
) build.

## Hardware

The hardware layout is documented using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org).

### Imported

I downloaded and imported the following parts into Fritzing:

- [DHT22 Humidity and Temperature Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/blob/master/parts/DHT22%20Humidity%20and%20Temperature%20Sensor.fzpz)
- [HC-SR501 Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR)](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/blob/master/parts/PIR%20sensor.fzpz)

### Exported

Don't worry if you don't have Fritzing, the `Hardware/Exported` folder contains screenshot of the breadbord, the schematics and a parts list.

Note however, that the `MagicMirror.fzz` file contains the latest changes, the screenshots and the parts list may be outdated.
